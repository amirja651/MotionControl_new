/**
 * @file    TMC5160Module.cpp
 * @brief   Intentionally empty: all code is in the header for clarity and inlining.
 *
 * Rationale:
 * - Keeping small wrappers header-only simplifies inlining of conversions and run() hot path.
 * - If you prefer, you can split definitions out; interfaces remain exactly the same.
